# D-ops Development Rules

## Overview
This is the main entry point for D-ops project development rules. These rules are designed to help AI assistants understand the codebase structure, patterns, and best practices for effective code generation and modification.

## Rule Structure
The rules are organized into focused modules for better maintainability and clarity:

### 🏗️ [Project Overview](mdc:.cursor/rules/project-overview.mdc)
Essential context about the D-ops application, its purpose, core business logic, and technology stack. Start here for understanding the project's scope and main entry points.

### 🎯 [Architecture Patterns](mdc:.cursor/rules/architecture-patterns.mdc)
Code organization principles, component architecture, state management patterns, and data flow. Critical for understanding how to structure new features and maintain consistency.

### 🎨 [Styling System](mdc:.cursor/rules/styling-system.mdc)
Complete design token system, color schemes, component styling patterns, and responsive design guidelines. Essential for maintaining visual consistency.

### 💾 [Data Patterns](mdc:.cursor/rules/data-patterns.mdc)
Database schema understanding, data fetching patterns, query optimization, and security considerations. Key for any database-related operations.

### 📋 [Development Guidelines](mdc:.cursor/rules/development-guidelines.mdc)
Code style standards, component development patterns, error handling, performance considerations, and security guidelines. Follow these for code quality.

### 🔧 [Common Tasks](mdc:.cursor/rules/common-tasks.mdc)
Step-by-step workflows for frequent development tasks like adding features, creating forms, integrating modals, and debugging common issues.

## Quick Reference
- **Default Theme**: Dark mode with custom color system
- **Primary Colors**: Blue for operations, Purple for design, Green for development
- **Form Pattern**: Modal-based with loading states and error handling
- **Data Layer**: Supabase with RLS policies
- **Authentication**: Required for all main features
- **Responsive**: Mobile-first with fixed sidebar navigation

## AI Assistant Instructions
When working on this codebase:
1. Always reference the relevant rule files for context
2. Follow the established patterns and conventions
3. Maintain consistency with existing code style
4. Test dark mode compatibility for all UI changes
5. Ensure mobile responsiveness for new components
6. Validate database operations follow security patterns

## Getting Started
For new features or modifications:
1. Read [Project Overview](mdc:.cursor/rules/project-overview.mdc) for context
2. Check [Architecture Patterns](mdc:.cursor/rules/architecture-patterns.mdc) for structure guidance
3. Follow [Common Tasks](mdc:.cursor/rules/common-tasks.mdc) for implementation workflows
4. Apply [Styling System](mdc:.cursor/rules/styling-system.mdc) for consistent UI
5. Use [Data Patterns](mdc:.cursor/rules/data-patterns.mdc) for database operations
